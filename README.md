## Brisbane Internet of Things Interest Group

presents a One-Day Workshop to assemble your own 3D printer and learn how to use it.

# Introduction to 3D Printing

Welcome!

Today we are going to assemble a 3D printer from a kit, and then learn how to use it.

We recommend one of three printers

  * The "TronXY X1", an inexpensive but reliable printer with a build volume of 15x15x15cm
  
  * The "TronXY X3A", a midrange printer with heated bed 22x22x30cm volume and auto-leveling

  * The "TronXY X3S", a larger version of the X3 with 30x30x30cm build volume
  
You can also bring your own printer (assembled, or new-in-box), and there are limited number
of our printers that you can borrow for the day if you are unsure whether you are ready to purchase your own printer.

You will find more information on each step in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/unixbigot/intro-to-3d-printing/wiki)
  
# How to Begin

Let's start with an explanation of what 3D Printing means.

There are several kinds of 3D printing technology, but today we are talking about Fused Filament Fa
